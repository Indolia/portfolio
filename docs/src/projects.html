            <p>
                Sophos ZTNA adheres to the principles of zero trust: trust nothing, verify everything. Individual users and devices form their own micro-segmented perimeters, undergoing constant validation and verification. In a zero-trust model, users are no longer automatically granted trust and access simply by being 'on the network.
                The solution allows for precise control over access to applications and data, relying on user identity and device health as key factors.
